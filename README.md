### Hi there 👋

I'm Jeff and I'm currently Director of Technology and Innovation at [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fffej/), [an unmaintained website](https://www.fatvat.co.uk/) or not [writing articles on Medium](https://jeff-foster.medium.com/).

More recently I've started writing again at [fffej.substack.com](https://fffej.substack.com).

Feel free to reach out to me.

### What am I interested in?

* 💡  - Anything that makes software easier; it's too hard!
  * Type systems?
  * Better static analysis?
  * Better human interaction?
  * Maybe it's agents?
